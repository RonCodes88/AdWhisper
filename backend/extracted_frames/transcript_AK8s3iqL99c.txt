I'm not here to tell you to buy American Eagle jeans, and I definitely won't say that they're the most comfortable jeans I've ever worn or that they make your butt look amazing.

But just so we're clear, this is not me telling you to buy American Eagle jeans. >> Sydney Sweeney Hazburg jeans. >> You see what I did there, right?
